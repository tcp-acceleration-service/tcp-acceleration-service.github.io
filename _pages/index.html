<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>TAS is a drop-in highly CPU efficient and scalable TCP acceleration service for
multi-tenant environments.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Requires no additional NIC hardware</li>
  <li>Compatible with existing applications that use sockets</li>
  <li>Uses dedicated cores for packet processing</li>
  <li>Leverages benefits and flexibility of kernel bypass with better
    protection</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>For small remote procedure calls (RPCs):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Throughput improved by 6x over Linux, comparable to
    kernel-bypass TCP stacks that do not provide protection or sockets.</li>
  <li>Tail latency up to 5.8x lower than Linux and 2.3x lower than
    kernel-bypass.</li>
  <li>Scalable to 100K active connections without throughput degradation</li>
  <li>Stable and fair distribution of bandwidth to connections under
    congestion.</li>
</ul>
